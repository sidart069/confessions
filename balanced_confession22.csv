"['From twelve to fifteen\n', '\n', ""I fell in love for the first time when I was twelve years old. Seems strange, right? I always believed in the philosophy that you can fall in love at any age. We were in gym together, he was fourteen but in eighth grade. I liked him and he thought I did, but we never talked about it. I am in band, and for the eighth grade graduation we had to play for the graduates. That graduation night, I realized there was someone that I loved more than him, someone that made me feel amazing inside and that I would do anything to be with. His brother. We had fun together that year; we were the 'little brother and sister' of the gym group and talked a lot. I think he even liked me at a point. For eighth grade I wasn't able to keep in contact with either of them. Freshman year, they were sophomores, I managed to talk to them more, and the younger brother knew that I liked him. We got closer from our talks every day. Come sophomore year, I decided to get off my lazy butt and ask him how he felt about me. Five minutes before I was going to walk up to him, my friend told me that he asked the year before and that he didn't like me that way. Of course, I was upset. I had fallen in love with his brother before, but this was a different kind of love. More genuine. I'm currently working on getting over him, but I still find myself craving the exact words he said, what he looked like when he said it, and so much more. It's things like these that make you feel like you're not good enough. But there was always the possibility that my friend was lying, because a friend of his likes me and he's been trying to set me up with him. It's really hard on me and I don't like to talk about it.""]",0
"['Hope she is doing well\n', '\n', ""Twenty-seven years ago I dumped a girl after a night of kissing on a school trip. I'm sure she felt she was being used, but I really did it because of the age difference (17 and 14). I was cowardly and did not want to be known as a senior who could only get a freshman girlfriend. I rarely spoke to her after that, and wish today that I knew whatever became of her so I could apologize -- not for the kissing, but for the horribly degrading way I just told her to get lost the next day.""]",0

The next thing I know the supervisor called me on a cell phone to open a door so he could come in (morning). A real dumb mistake. He was nice about it (I think) I have got in trouble before and actually got fired for sleeping. I think I am going down the toilet again as far as trying to better my life.']",0
"['Old Boss\n', 'I used to work for this total dork. The guy would do anything to get ahead, and especially if he could climb over your back to do it. He got transferred, and I sent him a greeting card full of glitter. I wrote in the card, ""hey jerk, I\'m glad you are gone!"" I just wish I could have been there when he opened the card and got pink glitter all over his blue uniform.\n']",0
"['They say marriage is hard work . . . .\n', '\n', 'I think this is a lie people in bad marriages tell themselves to feel better about marrying the wrong person. My marriage is no work at all. School is work. Jobs are work. Family is often work. Marriage is fun. Is everyone else just going along with this myth, or are there really that many bad matches? Or have we accidentally stumbled onto the secret - by waiting to marry until we had enough money to live on, by not having kids? Or is he really doing all the work for over a decade, and I am just taking advantage?']",0
"['Roomate\n', '\n', ""This isn't much of a confession, but I freakin hate my roommate. His is one of those guys that finds some way to annoy me in any way possible. For instance, it is a daily experience to find him snickering at his desk, only to look over at me waiting for me to ask what is so funny. I can usually hold out for about 4 minutes until I give in and he shows me some bit of internet humor that I discovered in the 8th grade. I bought some nice over-ear headphones, I never use them to listen to music, just to ignore what he is doing. Anyway, I could write a lengthy post on everything he does that annoys me (including how he is explaining to me how he needs to moisturize his feet more, and repeatedly asking me if I know a good foot moisturizer), but I don't have the will power to relive every annoyance, and not kill him. I'm moving into a private room in 2 weeks. Now I just wonder what new hell awaits me every morning until then. So the confession part of this, is that he is really a nice guy, but I mess with him all the time, just because I hate him so much. Yesterday I installed a trojan on his computer. Pretty lame confession, but he is such a mongrel idiot, I had to let someone know. Thanks for understanding.""]",0

When I was 10 I wrote a paper on how I wanted to kill myself but I got my journal mixed up with my school journal. My teacher talked to my parents who in turn asked me if I really wanted to commit suicide. I said no because I was ashamed and immediately they forgot about it and I never got treatment. I really did want to commit suicide and the only person who knows is my sister because she kept asking me about it.']",0

He even tried to kiss me one time. he's annoying, and i'm only thirteen! i'm afraid to tell a teacher.""]",0
"['She left me\n', '\n', 'I met a girl 6 months ago. I fell in love with her. She was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. I was missing work and getting depressed from thinking about her so much. I was the happiest I had ever been when she asked me out. Since then, I got texts saying she was never ever going to leave me, that she loved me more then anyone shed ever loved before, that she wanted to have me forever. Then she left me for someone else.']",0

"[""I'm in love with a coworker\n"", '\n', ""I've known and worked with J for about 1-1/2 years. We've been friends, spent time socially with one another. She even bought me a lap dance at a club once (she went along on the theory that we'd draw more attention with a girl with us than alone, and she was right.) Simply put, I've fallen in love with her. I've seen both her good side and her bad side, but everything seems better when she's around. We have similar views, similar upbringings, and have fun when we are together. She is currently unattached, although there is a (much younger) guy she's been hanging out with and seems to like, and it's pretty clear that she wants a relationship with this guy. We work at a small company, so there's no way a relationship between us could happen. Plus, I'm sure she's not interested, which makes me kick myself in the butt for allowing myself to feel anything for someone I know doesn't reciprocate. I'm old enough to know better.""]",1

It just so happened that my sister cassy was trying to make me jump for a prank....The hospital says that i had shot her clean through her diaphragm, she cant talk now.

"['animal abuse...\n', '\n', 'All my life ive made impulse buys of all kinds of animals: birds, rabbits, rats, axolots, turtles, mice, and most recently a dog. i guess i get comfort from taking care of them because i dont get along with people. but it seems the novelty always wears off and i end up abandoning them. once i left two mice in a tank without food for over a week and the bigger mouse had eaten the smaller one. i killed an axolotl simply because i was too lazy to change the water. ive let turtles go in a park pond, and abandoned a rat on a roof from a 2nd floor window. i did this knowing fully it probably wouldnt survive. also when i was 15 and had a pet parrot, it wasnt acting the way i wanted it to so i got frustrated, put it in a box and shook it very hard. the parrot was injured. ive also hit rabbits in anger. i got a puppy on impulse the other week and at first i was very caring and did my best to care for him. i spent over $500 in vet bills. but i found it harder and harder to control my temper when he whined, and i hit him twice. today i got in a cab and took him to a park, and left him there. hes only 9 weeks old. im scared of myself that i could do something like that almost robotically, without any emotion. the reason i didnt give him to a shelter is because i dont want people to know what an irresponsible animal abuser i am. i even have a plan to say he was stolen, and play the victim. ive never hurt an animal for pleasure, but the times i abused my bird/rabbit/dog, it was definitely abuse because i was taking my anger out on them. the scary thing is i also have a cat, ive never hurt him and hope i never will. i know people like me shouldnt have animals. im seeing a therapist but this is the one thing i could never, ever tell another human being in person. i know people who read this are going to be disgusted. honestly i dont really care how you react because i disgust myself too and i just wanted to get this off my back anonymously.']",0

We met around four years ago when he started dating one of my friends. They dated for about two weeks and during that time I became closer to him then I ever had to her. You know how people always ask ""Do you believe in love at first sight?"" Well with me it wasn\'t love at first sight. It was a sort of recognition, a connection I had found in someone I had never met before and yet found so very familiar. But you can bet your butt, the second time I looked I was gone. Game over. Hook line and sinker. A while after he broke up with my friend we started dating. It was mostly a long distance thing even though he only lived twenty five minutes away, but he didn\'t have a car and I didn\'t have a car and his parents didn\'t help him out with much especially when it came to seeing his friends, much less his girlfriend. It lasted all of three months. And it was wonderful. I missed him all the time when he wasn\'t there. I grew to love his voice, deep and dark and sometimes a bit gravely. I\'ll never have a better 4th of July. But then one day that all came to an end. He called me up drunk and told me that his ex had just told him how she was pregnant with his kid. We had an argument and I hung up on him because I just knew there was no reasoning with him when he was mad and piss drunk, and I didn\'t want to say anything I would regret. While I waited for him to sober up before I called him back I sat there and thought about the situation. I came to the conclusion that no matter what I would find a way to be with him more often, and I would be there for him no matter what. My will was set in stone. But it didn\'t go down like that. When I called him back he told me how he just wasn\'t in love with me anymore and that he couldn\'t even remember my face, only my eyes and my hair. He told me that he thought we needed to take a break. Right then I knew it was over. The very first day I met him he had told me how he didn\'t believe in breaks and I that he was just doing this until he could actually see me to break it off in person because that\'s the kinda guy he is. But I held out for hope and gave it a few weeks. During that time I thought about what it would mean to be in a relationship with a person who didn\'t love you. I thought about how if it ended I could do what I always did and get over it. I didn\'t want to be in love with a person who wasn\'t in love with me, who would never love me as much as I loved him. I didn\'t want to be someone that you settle for. I believed I deserved better and I still do. Anyway a few weeks later I called him up and asked what he thought about us, and he said he didn\'t know. I had had enough and broke it off with him. He told me it hurt but from the way he sounded I don\'t think it really did, at least not very much in comparison as his other break ups had. And just like that it was all over. We\'ve remained extreemly close friends since then even though we don\'t see each other very much because he lives way out in the country and with gas prices the way they are we just can\'t afford it. I\'ve seen him through a lot of relationships, and have always been there for him to talk to. Oh, and by the way, it turns out that the kid wasn\'t even his, which I know hurt like hell because before he found out he had gotten really attatched to the boy. In the last six months he\'s been recovering from the ending of a three year relationship. It was a bad break. He\'ll be going into the army soon, which I hope will give him a good change of pace and help him to heal somehow. I myself have been recovering from a bad relationship, and it hasn\'t been easy. My last relationship was the first time since me and my friend had broken up that I had opened myself up enough to let anybody in, and the person I did let in took advantage... extreem advantage. Before that I had just been bouncing around from one guy to the next because I didn\'t feel right about starting another relationship when I still had feeling for my friend. It just didn\'t feel right. I wish I could say that this was just a teenage thing that I just can\'t seem to let go. But time has proved otherwise. I even tried to cut him out of my life once because I thought that maybe we would be better off without each other. I avoided his calls for a year and when I finally did pick up the phone and call him it was more of a subconcious thing, I didn\'t really mean to do it... he was happy I had called though, a lot happier then I\'d thought he\'d be. Over the years we\'ve definatly had our disagreements but it\'s never really been hostile and from time to time when we are both single (and once when he was not) we\'ll become romantic. But there\'s an unspoken rule ya know. The last time after we had finished and we had gone into our in depth discussions which ended up with him talking about his ex, and for the first time I saw him cry because of the fact that he couldn\'t stop loving her. It broke my heart and I had to do one of the hardest things in my life which was tell him that the should try and get her back. He told me he had already tried and that she didn\'t want anything to do with him. Anyways after that he told me out of the blue that he loved me too. ""too?"" I said, ""I didn\'t say anything."" He just smiled and said ""Just to say..."" and I said I loved him too and kissed him. It wasn\'t meant as a confession of mutual feelings of romantic love. It wasn\'t a way of telling me that he wanted me back. I know that he\'s no where ready for another relationship and I know that even if he was it wouldn\'t be with me. And I know that even if he did want me it wouldn\'t work out because I go to college in a different state and he\'s basically going off to war. But I will never forget that moment. Not for as long as I live. I realize that I\'m setting myself up here, and please don\'t think I havn\'t tried to stop loving him because I\'ve been trying for more than four years now. In fact, a part of me has always hated him for the fact that I can\'t stop loving him. And I hate myself for not being able to stop, when I\'ve tried so damn hard. During that year we didn\'t speak, I didn\'t even say his name unless someone else brought him up which was all of three time if that many. But even when I didn\'t want it too, his name would always come into my mind, as reminder, as a prayer. I missed him terribly that year. So I\'ve come to the conclusion that no matter what, no matter how I want him in my life if only as a friend, if only to have him there. Because it just doesn\'t feel right with out him. The only thing I\'ve found to redeem my pride is since that day he told me he didn\'t love me anymore I havn\'t shed one tear over him. He can have my body and my heart but I\'ll be damned if he can have my pride. I\'ll be God Damned.']",0

She went to Paris for a week, and whatever happened there (or perhaps my lack of willingness to commit - again because I\'m a dumb jerk) put her off me. She\'s perfect, and I knew it would never last (there\'s no way a girl like her could date down forever, but I thought I would have a good enough run, before I had to off and take my turn at sowing my wild oats - I\'m only seventeen after all) but it\'s no less painful. When I got that ""we should just be friends"" text (and yes it was a text - Fitzgerald would not approve. Ironically enough she was a fan of The Great Gatsby, and wrote an essay on the theme of technology creating distance between people that won a nationwide prize...) I almost cried, in public no less. Usually when I break up with a girl, I focus on what\'s wrong with her. I can\'t find anything of substance in this case - my only problems with her stemmed from my (well hidden) jealousy of her intelligence (six months younger than me and already with an offer to the best medical school in the country - something I still lack and not for want of trying), and that she didn\'t like me talking about other girls (before we were going out, I hasten to add).

I would say it is a bit late for her at her age of 31 (she is very good looking), and when I'm happy for her, I feel sad - it means that she's gone for me forever.

If anybody else has had to go through this i am sorry and you are not alone. ever since that day i have never been a tom boy, i have always worn make up and i always cry when i pass by the picture of him hanging in my school hallway, it has been two years but it feels like yesterday whenever it think about it. I havent been able to move on. And every october 5th i go tomboy for the day and carry a picture of us together, his favorite one, in my back pack. the very picture my mom took away because she hated seeing me so depressed every time i saw it. I have never let myself fall in love since and no matter what people say about trying to move on i cant i cant get over the fact that my first love ended so harsh so now i try to get through every day knowing that mike would have wanted me to be happy.

I am in band, and for the eighth grade graduation we had to play for the graduates.

We had fun together that year; we were the 'little brother and sister' of the gym group and talked a lot. I think he even liked me at a point. For eighth grade I wasn't able to keep in contact with either of them. Freshman year, they were sophomores, I managed to talk to them more, and the younger brother knew that I liked him. We got closer from our talks every day. Come sophomore year, I decided to get off my lazy butt and ask him how he felt about me. Five minutes before I was going to walk up to him, my friend told me that he asked the year before and that he didn't like me that way. Of course, I was upset. I had fallen in love with his brother before, but this was a different kind of love. More genuine. I'm currently working on getting over him, but I still find myself craving the exact words he said, what he looked like when he said it, and so much more. It's things like these that make you feel like you're not good enough.

Her husband is away from her a lot of the time and I know that can not be very healthy for her relationship. Love, I know that you know, that I still love you so much.... and I always will. We had some very difficult times, but I also remember some very, very good times and the ""munchies"" we shared together. Who knows, maybe someday, in this life, we could have a chance to be together again. I don\'t count on it, but I do wish it could happen. Even if it was in the later years of our life, I wouldn\'t mind. I would be a better partner this time around. I have matured and learned so much to share with you.

"['Chew Toy\n', '\n', 'On Monday, in the year 2007, my dog, Puddles, died. Puddles died from ingesting a chew toy I bought him from a store Here is an account of how things happened... When I brought the toy home for Puddles I was so excited. At last a toy for Puddles that he could chew on. Puddles was still a puppy, and although he had a number of stuffed friends he did not yet have a chew toy. This was going to be a special experience for Puddles. As I expected Puddles was delighted with his new toy and very soon began chewing on it whenever he had the opportunity. Unfortunately over time Puddles relentless chewing began to wear down the toy and I noticed bits of plastic in his stool, however I didn?t think much of it at the time and Puddles kept gnawing away. A curious thing happened one day, I was watching Puddles chewing away at his toy when gradually, ever so slowly he began to chew less enthusiastically, eventually stopping altogether and setting the toy down. He stared at his toy for a long time then got up carefully backing away as if he were trying to escape the toy, struggling against some inexorable force which wouldn?t let him go. He made it as far as the other room, but within 15 minutes he was back at it, chewing away feverishly. Puddles eventually chewed the toy down so far that he was able to partially swallow it, a discovery I made after responding to his tortured screaming. I ran into the room to find Puddles writhing on his side, laying in a spreading pool of bloody vomit. His mouth was levered open and I could clearly see the chew toy lodged in the back of his throat, panicking I forced my hand into his mouth and extracted the worn toy. Puddles recovered with no lasting problems, and seemed to be a bright and happy little dog within a few days, but as time went on Puddles seemed to lapse into a depression. He would mope through the days and was no longer full of bustling puppy energy. I became more and more concerned with Puddles behavior and consequently took to following him around the house in an effort to determine the source of his malady. I soon noticed that Puddles would return over and over to the same spot in the house. The place where I used to store his chew toy. He missed his toy, I could hardly believe it considering the awful hell he had gone through, but it was undeniable. I presented him different a brand of chew toy. One I thought would be more suitable for a dog with his powerful jaws, but he had fixated on his first toy. He would play with the new ones in a half hearted fashion but inevitably he would lose interest in them and mope about until I relented and returned his precious toy to him. It was like a miracle, Puddles was a new dog, he was happy and full of energy. You could find him at any time chewing away at his toy as happy as a pig in slop, this time I promised myself everything would be fine as long as I made sure to replace his toy before it was too worn out. Over the course of a few months Puddles chewed his way through that toy over and over again, I eventually began to notice that Puddles was no longer having as many or as large a bowel movement as was usual for him. I also noticed that his gums were constantly bleeding and he seemed to be getting sick. I attempted to take the chew toy away from him but this only made things worse. He was addicted to this toy, no matter how damaging it was to him he seemed unable to get on without it. Puddles never recovered from his downward spiral. On the day I found him dead his chew toy was firmly clamped in his jaws. Horribly he had bled to death from the inside out. Twin streams of blood issued forth from his mouth and butt. When the vet preformed the autopsy he was shocked at the state of Puddles intestinal tract. It was pitted and necrotic, every square inch was shredded, he had virtually rotted from the inside out. Please, if your dog is chewing on a toy that is hurting him don?t make the same mistake I made. Take the toy from him and don?t give in to his sadness. I wish everyday that Puddles was still alive, I gave the toy to him just wanting him to have fun and enjoy himself, I had never planned for him to play with it to the exclusion of all else. But ultimately his death is on my hands for not being firm, puppies don?t know better. Perhaps if I had started Puddles off playing with chew toys early or multiple toys he would have known that there was no reason to be so crazy for his first. Please, don?t let this happen to you.']",0

No matter what happens our friendship will last a lifetime. I don't care what happens I will always be there. Nothing you ever say or do could make me love you any less. I don't care about a physical relationship. If I never held your hand again, or never kissed you, I wouldn't love you any less. People will scoff at me because I am a teenage boy and I'm supposed to be cool and be with as many girls as I can but I don't care. I may sound naive saying these things but they don't know me. They don't know what I am. They are merely cynical people who don't love enough. Sometimes I feel like you don't appreciate me though. I have never lied even once to you. I have even told you things that you didn't want to here if only because they were true and you needed to hear them. I never broke a promise that I have made to you. Whenever you have been down I have been there to pick you up. You may not have let me but I was there. I would take a bullet for you. It wouldn't be a hard decision. I have thought about it many times and I simply value your life more than my own. If my entire purpose of being alive and on earth was to keep you living I would be fine with that. Anyone who claims that I speak empty words is mistaken. They don't know me. They may think that I write this in a moment of infatuation but I have made a decision to love you. I don't feel like loving you, I have chosen to love you. We have had many hard times but even when you were at your lowest point and said things that you didn't mean. I never once stopped loving you. I'm sorry if I ever hurt you. I am just a man and I make mistakes, even with the best intentions. You compare me to many of your friends at school. The ones with big muscles who work out. I work out too. Maybe not as much but I guarantee you, I could beat any one of them. Even just out of sheer determination and will. I could beat them because I am fueled by love which I will never run out of and I would never give up. Know this: I Love You, and I always will. No matter what happens.

It seizes up and my chest contracts, almost painfully. I don't really know what it is but it happens a lot. I hate people like myself, though. The type of person who lives this kind of life and does nothing about it. I'm proud to say I don't complain about being alone or miserable, though. It's really the only part of my personality that I like. I don't want to be a burden to others. Telling them or unloading my problems onto them will only make me more pathetic. I don't like feeling this way, yet I continue to foster the way my life is going. Several years ago, when I was around 17, I sat down with myself and came to the conclusion that I will most likely die alone and without anyone to morn me. Probably from heart failure in my forties or something like that. Now, four years down the line, I find myself wanting to to happen sooner. The only thing that keeps me around is the guilt of knowing what it would do to my parents. When they are gone, will I care anymore? I really don't know, but I also finding myself waiting for that to happen. When I don't have any more emotional attachments. Anyway, don't be like me. That's all I can say.""]",0

I know I have made mistakes in this relationship, and I hearbye admit that those mistakes where mine and mine alone. I have a selfish side that can come out and also my moods differ greatly depending on stress. I really love you Xander. I remember when I waited anxiously all day thinking of nothing else but getting a phone call from you. You where my everything and I was willing to travel to the ends of the earth and back just to see you. But Xander, you have screwed up royally. I can\'t even begin to find the words to describe how messy our lives together have gotten. And in reality most people dealing with this type of stuff are like, almost ten years older than me. Look, a lot of it has to do with hypocritical stuff you pulled. Random stupidness that was selfish and stingy that\'s the stuff that I can eventually grow to forgive. But there were other things. Things that weren\'t just superficial. Or maybe; One thing in particular. You told me you were in love with another person, for almost a whole two years. You claim that your reason for doing this was a complete class act of revenge upon my infidelity. Well, if this is true you probably wanted me to manifest negative emotions. Possibly the same way you yourself may have been feeling should this be true. Fear, Jealousy, Sadness, Envy, Regret, The list goes on and on. But in my greatest honesty I felt no such thing. Yes sadness came much later to date. But first I did what I seem to do best in this world. I sat. Yes, I did a lot of thinking. After I sat, and while I sat. I both sat, and thought for a very, very long time. Most of your average juvenile teens around here would have probably looked about this the wrong way. They would develop some strange way of hating this other girl who stole what was supposed to be the only thing that\'s theirs, and theirs alone. Their boyfriend. They proably would have sat for a while yes. Then gotten all jealous and done something stupid. I\'d like to think that after all the things I been through I have a more peaceful resolve. You see, I strongly believe that the heart has a mind of its own. Sometimes it may even makes decisions for us. And when you cry to the heart it does listen, sometimes with a capacity far greater than the human mind. And while sitting and thinking I also listened to my heart.

You were my total preoccupation, believe me. I wondered why I should ever get carried away by somebody I hadn't met before. Are there any particular things that I was hungry for that I found in you?

The closer you get to me, it seems the more I love you. A heart truly in love never loses hope but always believes in the promise of love, no matter how long the time and how far the distance.

"[""It's hard for me to tell you how I feel, because no one in my previous relationships has wanted what we have. And if they had, I was afraid to tell them I cared because I was afraid of being hurt. Please bear with me, I'm working on it. I will slowly be able to tell you how I feel and what I'm thinking.""]",1
"[""You've walked into my life and totally turned it around. I was so depressed and torn up about what had happened to me in the last year or so that I was ready to give up. You gave me the hope that I needed to keep on going. I am so grateful for having you in my life. I've been waiting for someone just like you to walk into my life. Thank you for everything.""]",1
"[""I'd like you to know that I love you so much, more than I have ever loved anyone. I just want to stay with you while I can for as long as you'll let me.""]",1
"[""Thanks for taking my advice so seriously. Those who learn from others' experience are usually a step ahead of the rest. Purchasing a home within your means now is a wise move. I'm sure you've done the right thing. You're young and will have time to purchase a larger home later. It's important to build equity now. It looks like you have a great future.""]",1
"['I am pleased that you have taken my advice to begin saving through payroll deduction. If you place at least three percent of your gross salary each month into a tax sheltered annuity, the company will contribute another three percent. If you continue your savings and increase them gradually, you will have a very nice retirement income after 30 years. Saving this way was the best advice I received when I joined Doe Corporation, and I am always eager to pass it on to new employees. Best wishes for a happy, prosperous career.']",1
"['I was very pleased when I learned you had decided to go ahead with my recommendation to decrease the workweek to four nine-hour days. While it is true that this plan will not succeed in some industries, ours seems to be one where the potential benefits merit this bold experiment. I hope the new workweek is as good to you as it has been to me.']",1
"['Thank you for implementing my suggestion regarding air quality management in our shop. Ever since the new filtration system was installed I have felt healthier, and our productivity has risen just over 10 percent. It is a pleasure to work in an environment where employee suggestions are taken seriously.']",1
"[""I'm sure it was very disappointing to lose the Doe account after all your hard work. However, I want you to know I have never seen a more polished first-time presentation by a new employee. Given your skills, I am confident that you will have many more opportunities to make sales presentations for the company, and that many of them will result in new accounts. Take care!""]",1
"[""I understand how difficult it has been to work under the tighter budget introduced last year. As I am sure you understand, this is an attempt to streamline our operations by adopting more efficient methods of training and production. You may not know, however, that our production levels increased by nearly twenty percent in the last quarter. This increase is due to the hard work of employees like you who aren't afraid to innovate and finesse solutions to problems rather than throw money at them. At this rate the original budget will come back on track in no time, with revenues up as much as fifty percent. Keep up the good work!""]",1
"[""I realize that some problems have cropped up in the department since you took over as supervisor. As you know, the employees were particularly loyal to John Doe, and we expected some resistance to his replacement. But take heart. I have seen your calm, steady influence in the department and have no doubt that the employees will learn to work well with you. Keep up the good work. We're behind you all the way.""]",1
